# Comp-Physics-Final-Project
We will conduct an analysis of traffic build-up dependence on car density using the Nagel–Schreckenberg traffic CA model.

Planned directory structure:


Code Plan:
- Write/code model to develop math behind car density to traffic function
- Write/code to model the proportionality between density, time and other factors compared to the traffic build up
- Build(in python) graphs to simulate different traffic jam scenarios
- With any extra time, we will propose a solution to these traffic jams (civil engineering approach)
- With any extra extra time, we will try to code a mathematical simulation of this new proposal

Contributions:
- Laila: Help build visuals and write descriptions for different sections and present final project
- Cosmo: Create graphs to simulate different traffic jam scenarios / Code the proportionality between density, time, and other factors compared to the traffic build up.
- Charles: Provide potential solutions to traffic jams (civil engineering)
- Juan: Write/code model to develop math behind car density to traffic function
- Everyone: come up with potential switches to the code to get less traffic
